Here is some C++ code on Arduino IDE for my ESP32-based Automated Irrigation System with IoT Data Collection

Start Date: February 2025
End Date: ongoing
Location: The Learning Farm (TLF), Kawungluwuk Village, Sukaresmi, Cianjur Regency, West Java, Indonesia
Description:
To confirm the feasability of IoT-based automated irrigation systems with ESP32 microcontrollers in Javanese highland farming conditions,
various ESP32 prototypes and an automated irrigation system were implemented in TLF, collecting data on water usage, electricity usage, crop growth, crop health, etc.
This repository possesses the code required to operate these systems.
